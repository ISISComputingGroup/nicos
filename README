  - mock
  - coverage (optional)
  - sphinx (for generating doc)

* Under Windows:

  - colorama (optional, for colored console output)

Detailed version requirements can always be found in the requirements.txt
file in the root of the source tree.

If not supplied by the distribution (see below), most dependencies (except
PytQt, PyQwt, sip) can be installed from the python package repository:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Development and documentation build dependencies can be installed with:

  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

pip can be obtained from http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

For xBuntu 12.04:

Install pip:
  sudo apt-get install python-pip

Pip on xBuntu 12.04 is an outdated version, we need at least pip 1.4. To update
pip use the following lines:

  sudo pip install --upgrade pip
  hash -r
