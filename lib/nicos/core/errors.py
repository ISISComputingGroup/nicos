    """The basic exception class for exceptions raised by NICOS.

    Every NicosError subclass has a "category" attribute, a string that is shown
    to the user instead of the exception class.

    The constructor also accepts a :class:`.Device` instance as its first
    argument, which is then used to display the error to the user as coming from
    this device.  For example::

       def doRead(self, maxage=0):
           if not self._ready:
               raise NicosError(self, 'device is not ready')

    The constructor accepts a the keyword *wikicode* with an integer argument to
    create a link to a wiki page

       https://trac.frm2.tum.de/projects/NICOS/wiki/NicosError/<integer>

    where more information can be given.  The integer should be the Unix
    timestamp (e.g from ``date +%%s``, to get a uniqe id) of the first use of
    this specific error.  To create the wiki page, log in to trac and enter
    'wiki:NicosError/<integer>' in the search box on the upper right.
