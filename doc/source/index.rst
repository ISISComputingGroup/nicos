Welcome to NICOS |version|
==========================

NICOS is a network-based control system written for neutron scattering
instruments at the `FRM II <http://frm2.tum.de/>`_.  Its main goals are
flexibility, ease of use and maintenance and reusability.

This version of NICOS, called NICOS-2, is a completely rewritten code base that
still incorporates much the design and philosophy of NICOS version 1.
