.. _daemon:

The NICOS execution daemon
==========================

The NICOS execution daemon (usually just called "NICOS daemon") is the server
part of the client-server execution shell.  It runs NICOS commands and scripts
entered by the user from a client, e.g. the ``nicos-gui`` or ``nicos-client``.

Multiple clients can connect to the same daemon, and an authentication system is
in place to determine which user has which privileges.


Invocation
----------

The daemon is invoked by the ``nicos-daemon`` script.  It should normally be
started by the :ref:`init script <initscript>`.

There are no special command-line arguments.  The daemon expects a setup file
with a device named ``Daemon``.  The file must be named either ``daemon.py`` or
:file:`daemon-{name}.py`, where ``name`` is a user-defined name.  On startup
using the ``nicos-daemon`` executable, the setup loaded is either ``daemon.py``
if started with no arguments, or ``daemon-name.py`` if started with argument
``name``.


Setup file
----------

A simple setup file for the daemon could look like this::

  description = 'setup for the execution daemon'
  group = 'special'

  import hashlib

  devices = dict(
      Auth   = device('services.daemon.auth.ListAuthenticator',
                      hashing = 'sha1',
                      # first entry is the user name, second the hashed password, third the user level
                      passwd = [('guest', '', 'guest'),
                                ('user', hashlib.sha1('user').hexdigest(), 'user'),
                                ('admin', hashlib.sha1('admin').hexdigest(), 'admin')],
                     ),
      Daemon = device('services.daemon.NicosDaemon',
                      server = 'localhost',
                      authenticators = ['Auth'],
                     ),
  )

The Daemon device needs to have a ``server`` parameter that specifies the
listening address ``host:port`` (the default port being 1301).

It also has a list attached devices, the ``authenticators``.  Authenticators
determine if the login name and password presented in clients are accepted by
the daemon, and which user level the user gets.

There are several other parameters that can be configured, but the standard
setting is usually sufficient:

* ``maxlogins`` -- maximum number of simultaneous clients served, default 10
* ``updateinterval`` -- interval in which watch expressions are checked and
  updates sent to the clients, default 0.2 s
* ``trustedhosts`` -- a list of host names or addresses that are allowed to log
  in; the default is an empty list, which means that all hosts are allowed
* ``simmode`` -- whether to start the daemon in simulation mode

The ``simmode`` parameter is useful if you want to configure two daemon
instances, one running normally and one running exclusively in simulation mode.
For this purpose the possibility of multiple daemon setups (see above) also
comes in handy.


.. _userlevels:

User levels
-----------

There are three user levels: GUEST, USER, and ADMIN.  A higher user level can
stop scripts running started by a lower user level.

Also, individual devices and methods can be defined as requiring a certain user
level, see :func:`.requires` and the `.Moveable.requires` parameter.
